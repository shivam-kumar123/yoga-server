## Future Scope

- Nginx can be used as reverse Proxy as each client and server are a microservice
- Consisent hashing can be implemented on Nginx server for effective load balancing if multiple server instance are present 
- database sharding can be done for making resilient system
- master slave architecture can be adopted for database for database failover prevention
